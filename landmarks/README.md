Implementation:
	- All aspects of the assignment have been implemented correctly, including
	  the idenification of current location, displaying icons for user,
	  classmates, and landmarks, and info windows when icons are clicked.
	  

Collaboration:
	- I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment. However, I did use
	  code examples for the Haversine Formula, found in the distanceBetween() 
	  function (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine
	  -formula-in-javascript). I also used Ming's Geolocation Map 
	  (http://tuftsdev.github.com/WebProgramming/examples/google_maps/
	  geolocation_map.html) as an example for initializing the map setup and
	  display without using an API key.

Hours Spent:
	- Approximately 6 hours
