Purpose:
	This repository includes projects and labs from Comp20 (Web Programming). 
	All of these assignments were completed and submitted in the Spring of
	2016, using this shared repository to turn in assignments.

Favorite Assignment:
	My favorite assignment was Assignment 2 - Landmarks. This assignment was
	very helpful to learn the Google Maps API, but also how to use and research
	different APIs in general. It was fun to create a final product that could
	easily be shown off to friends and others, as the map display, geolocation,
	etc. were all aspects that anyone could appreciate, with or without coding
	experience.

Growth Throughout Course:
	I feel like I have grown as a programmer, since many of these projects
	required start-to-finish coding, testing, and debugging. The practice of
	doing larger coding projects consistently really helps to hone a skill.
	Additionally, I have grown significantly as an independent learner. Much of
	this course requires outside research, deciphering the spec, Googling error
	messages, and other independent pursuits. This has shown me what real-world
	problem-solving will look like, and has trained me to be better at finding
	the answers for myself. Overall, these skills are greatly beneficial, both
	as a programmer and as a person, so I feel like I have measurably grown
	throughout this course.

Most Important Thing Learned:
	I feel like the most important thing I've learned this semester is how to
	use Git and GitHub. I have used GitHub in a previous class before, but I
	felt entirely confused by the concept and typed a vague commit message
	only after large aspects of the project were complete. Now, not only do I
	understand how to use Git better (commiting, branching, merging), I also
	understand WHY we use Git and GitHub, as well as the importance of revision
	control. With this information, I can't believe I ever coded without it, 
	especially when it comes to group projects. Also, I know the importance of 
	a helpful commit message. These skills will definitely be helpful in future
	coding projects, especially when working with others, and the understanding
	behind it will help to support that.

Topic to Pursue:
	I am very curious to learn more about backend development and server-side
	things. Since we only did one assignment with a server (A3), I felt like I
	didn't get full exposure to those concepts. While I enjoyed doing front-end
	development, I want to learn more about the server-side. I felt as though 
	most of A3 was pretty straight-forward and repetitive, so I didn't get full
	experience on the huge range of abilities for server-side code, beyond just
	simple GET and POST. I'm not sure what else exists in the realm of server-
	side, which is exactly why this is what I hope to pursue.
