Implementation:
	- All aspects of the lab have been implemented correctly, including the
	  parsing of the JSON file, the displaying in HTML (with styling).

XMLHttpRequest Questions:
	The instructions for part 2 and 3 both did not work and should not work for
	this project. We cannot request data from a different origin or our local
	machine. This is because they are not from the same origin and considered
	a cross-origin request, which would be a security threat if the JavaScript
	was malicious. The only way in which we can access the JSON is if the
	access is from another URL with the same protocol, port, and host.

Collaboration:
	- I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

Hours Spent:
	- Approximately 1.5 hours
